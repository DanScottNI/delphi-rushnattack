1.  Introduction 
______________________________________________________________________________________

Trip'n Slip is an editor for the NES game by Konami, Rush'n Attack. The project itself 
started around the 29th September 2003, and was iced about a week after. However, it 
was picked up again on the 23th of February 2004 and upgraded to my own editor user 
interface standards. It was written and compiled under Delphi 7 Personal, on the Windows XP operating system but should run on anything better than a Windows 98 system 
(although this has not been confirmed).

Trip'n Slip contains the following features:

- Full Level Editing
- TSA/Attribute Editing
- Palette Editing
- 8x8 Tile Editing
- Enemy Editing (With adding and deleting)
- ROM Properties editing
- Creation of IPS patches (thanks to FuSoYa's Lunar IPS/Compress)

If you find any bugs, or have any suggestions (not ones like make it faster, 
as unless you provide code which you know is faster than mine, you'll be 
getting the middle finger son) pm me. Or e-mail me.
